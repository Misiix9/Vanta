            ## ⚠️ Pre-release — Proceed with caution
            This is an early release of the **Ultimate Theme Engine**. The default bundled theme is not fully polished yet. Expect rough edges in the default visual style. Custom themes work correctly — you are encouraged to create your own `.css` file in `~/.config/vanta/themes/` and select it from the Settings screen.

            ## What's New in ${{ steps.get_version.outputs.VERSION }}

            ### Ultimate Theme Engine
            - **Borderless Transparent Window**: The app window is now fully undecorated and transparent, acting as a pure canvas for CSS-driven designs.
            - **External CSS Theming**: All visual styles have been moved out of the app binary. Themes live in `~/.config/vanta/themes/*.css` and are loaded at runtime — no rebuilds required.
            - **Theme Parser**: The Rust backend parses `/* Theme Name: */`, `--vanta-width`, and `--vanta-height` directly from your CSS files, enabling per-theme window sizing.
            - **Hot-Swap in Settings**: A new **Theme Profile** dropdown in Settings lets you switch themes live without restarting. The window resizes automatically.
            - **Smart Installer**: The `install` command now routes `.css` files into `~/.config/vanta/themes/` automatically (local paths and remote URLs both work).
            - **Bundled Default Theme**: A default theme is seeded to `~/.config/vanta/themes/default.css` on first launch so the app always looks correct out of the box.

            ### Bug Fixes & Improvements
            - Fixed settings panel bleed-through: settings and clipboard views now fully cover the launcher.
            - Fixed Escape in clipboard mode: now closes the window instead of returning to launcher.
            - Removed TailwindCSS build dependency — the frontend is now a pure unstyled Svelte bundle.
            - Clipboard history and settings views no longer render the launcher behind them.

            ---

            ## ⚠️ Known Issues
            - The bundled `default.css` is functional but not fully styled — some elements may appear basic or unstyled. This will be addressed in `v1.8.1`.
            - Theme hot-reload does not force a window re-center if dimensions are unchanged.
